Problem: Arabic filenames (بلات.jpg) caused ERR_INVALID_CHAR 
because R2 object keys and HTTP headers only accept ASCII
 characters. 
 Solution: Generate ASCII-only storage keys 
(courses/id/timestamp_hash.jpg) for R2, but store original 
Arabic names in database for display.
Result: Users see Arabic filenames 
in UI, but storage system uses safe ASCII keys internally.

impossible and insecure. Token verification can only happen
on the server side with Firebase Admin SDK.

  You're calling checkConnection(file.filename) inside the render, which:

❌ Calls an async function on every render
❌ Makes a Firebase query for EVERY file on EVERY render
❌ If you have 10 files, that's 10+ Firebase calls constantly!
❌ The function doesn't even return anything properly

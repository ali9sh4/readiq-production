Problem: Arabic filenames (بلات.jpg) caused ERR_INVALID_CHAR 
because R2 object keys and HTTP headers only accept ASCII
 characters. 
 Solution: Generate ASCII-only storage keys 
(courses/id/timestamp_hash.jpg) for R2, but store original 
Arabic names in database for display.
Result: Users see Arabic filenames 
in UI, but storage system uses safe ASCII keys internally.

impossible and insecure. Token verification can only happen
on the server side with Firebase Admin SDK.

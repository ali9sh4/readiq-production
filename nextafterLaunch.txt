Option 1111111111: Add Tracking (Backend work)
Track video watching patterns to detect suspicious behavior:
What to track:

Who watched what video
How many times
Download attempts
Multiple simultaneous sessions
Sharing account signs

Where to store:
typescript// Firebase structure:
/video-analytics/{userId}/{courseId}/{videoId}
  - watchCount: number
  - lastWatched: timestamp
  - devices: string[]
  - ipAddresses: string[]
  - suspiciousActivity: boolean
When to flag as suspicious:

Same account watching from 5+ different IPs in one day
10+ watches of same video
Multiple simultaneous sessions
Rapid course completion (1 hour for 10-hour course)

Firebase function to log video plays
Dashboard to view analytics
Alert system for suspicious patterns

If you DO want to fix it, here's the rule:
- **Use `error`** for error messages: `{ success: false, error: "..." }`
- **Use `message`** for success messages: `{ success: true, message: "..." }`
